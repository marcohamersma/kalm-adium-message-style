========================

This is a fork of Jeroen van Meerendonk's [Kalm](https://github.com/jeroen/kalm-adium-message-style) Message Style:

    A simple, clean message style for [Adium IM](http://adium.im/), the OS X instant messaging client. 

I've adjusted it to be a bit more iOS7 like:
- Avatars are now round
- Main font is now Helvetica Neue, without sub-pixel antialiasing to resemble the font rendering on iOS
- Introduces a header for chats displaying the recipient's name or group chat topic
- Introduces an additional variant that removes the sender names from the chat. Useful for 1-on-1 chats when the avatar or header speaks enough.
- Status messages don't take up as much space as they used to (especially troublesome on group chats). I aim to experiment more with this.
